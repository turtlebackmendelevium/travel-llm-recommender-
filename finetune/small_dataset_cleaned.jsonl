The door staff were great, they found us a taxi at rush hour in the rain which in NYC isn't the easiest thing to do.\nThe only problem we had was that our safe was not working when we arrived, (battery was duff) but this was fixed within 20 mins.\nOverall, no complaints, would definitely return again."}

After checking in, we were tired and hungry, so we found the restaurant downstairs which was still open. Our food was very good, so good that we decided to go back the next morning for the breakfast buffet. The buffet was exceptional as well, with a large variety of options. My husband needed help with tying his tie and the wonderful staff at the front desk were happy to help. :-) All in all, would recommend this hotel for not only those associated with the UH campus, but for any travelers who want a nice place to stay for a reasonable amount of money."}

And being right on 6th Ave, it's also very easy to get a cab uptown. The quick taxi ride to or from Grand Central is only about $5.\nOne of the best things about the location is that it's only a few blocks from the High Line park, which is a great way to take a walk downtown.\nThe rooms are always clean and comfortable and are of generous size for New York.\nBottom line: I recommend it highly and will certainly stay here again."}

We went out for breakfast the first morning (Saturday) and had to walk about 1 mile before we found a restaurant that was OPEN! They all close on the weekends.

The Location is relatively quiet and well placed with the subway nearby and central park, Rockefeller centre, times square and Grand Central all within walking distance. We stayed on the 11th floor and had a suite with a Queen Bed and a sofa bed for the kids. The room was certainly big enough for us and had a kitchenette which we used for making the kids snacks. We enjoyed the breakfast which was nice and simple (some cereal, juice, fruit, toast , bagels and some pastries). I could not drink the coffee ( not unusual) but did like the hot chocolate machine.\nThe service we got from the staff at the hotel was excellent and they were very tolerant and good with the kids.

Our room was clean, the bed was very comfortable. The pool area is also very nice, they have a huge indoor pool on the top floor with a jacuzzi area as well, and an outdoor sundeck with great views of the city. \nSadly this hotel was booked for the weekend we're planning to go back for the Texas Ren Fair, but I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Only advice is to look for their specials and packages, you can get some really great deals, but the hotel is worth the extra money!"}

An absolutely perfect experience, check-in to check-out. On arrival, we received immediate attention -- friendly, professional and most important for me, non-stuffy. Front desk service was genuine and helpful. Everything about our room was terrific - super comfortable and quiet. As close as this classy boutique hotel is to Times Square, we did not hear a peep from the outside world. We look forward to getting back to The Chatwal again, and when we return, hope to dine at the Lambs Club restaurant (big fans of Mr. Zakarian and the Food Network's Chopped)."}

I've never stayed somewhere in NYC that was so quiet and was able to get a good night's sleep. I travel to Penn and this hotel was within walking distance, which I like. There are also great restaurants nearby as well as a nice one in the hotel. I got free breakfast because I booked online and the breakfast was delicious, seriously. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous. I will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend."}

The hotel staff was very nice and yes there was a lot of students in training. The room was a bit dated but clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quite. My only complaints are the fact that the air conditioning could not be set to a certain degree, it was either on freezing or nothing at all. I tried to adjust the thermastat but to no avail. The other issue is the need for a token to exit the parking lot. This meant you were constantly asking the front desk for them. If you forgot it requires a trip back upstairs to the lobby. All in all for the right price (under $125) I would stay again any more and I would have to think twice."}

We were greeted by the General Manager himself - Robert - and he made us feel welcome immediately!\nThe room itself was a lovely oasis on the 17th floor, and we enjoyed the modern design. There is so much to see and quickly get food close by, and we always looked forward to coming back after being out on the town. It's so close to walk to everything - Macy's is 5 mins, and Times Square takes no time at all to walk, and there were lots of cabs around.\nThe breakfast buffet was delicious and we definitely raided the minibar, being Kimpton loyalty members.\nAll in all - we loved the weekend and can't wait to come back again! I most highly recommend the Eventi for what it offers and where it is located.\nAll in all - an amazing trip"}

They were opening up the street below the hotel. Even with the construction going on, we had a wonderful stay because the room was so nice."}

I was there on business but it would be a great hotel for couples who are exploring NY.\nThe lobby area is small but with very clean lines and a minimal feel to it. The service throughout the hotel is faultless. The rooms are small but again perfectly appointed for a luxury hotel. Don't expect a view you'll be overlooking another building, but hey when all's said and done you're in NY, very few hotels have a view. I miss the Plaza for that!\nThe bar area is ok, but again small and will get very busy. Even as a resident you'll need to be lucky to get a seat during the early evening.\nI didn't eat dinner at the hotel, but I believe it was just the one restaurant. The breakfast was fine, if a little pricey. Nothing spectacular on that front.\nOverall if you want to pay the price, it's a great hotel very well located, and I'd definitley stay there again for business or pleasure."}

I asked for the itemized tab and found that a 20% tip had been added in at her (the waitress) discretion. I followed up with an email to the general manager. He responded that he would take this response very seriously and would follow-up when all parties had been identified. We are now in June 2012.

Not only did Patrick at the Front Desk greet us with a warm smile when we arrived early, he sent us a lovely bottle of wine and fruit as welcome gift! Kimpton hotels know how to provide an experience to their guests -- free WiFi for In Touch members, complimentary member upgrades, a hosted wine hour each night, and clean, comfortable accommodations. Everything was great -- the space was sufficient for 2 ladies, the bed was comfortable, the shower luxurious, and the entire staff welcomed you with a genuine smile and gentle demeanor. For us, the location was perfect. It was easy to get to the Subway and we felt safe coming and going by foot at night. Thanks for a great experience Eventi... especially my personal super star, Patrick!"}

Bathroom was small but functional. Breakfast was included but I didn't try it - looked like the usual continental buffet. My only hesitation in recommending this hotel is a very limited room service menu that comes from the Indian restaurant next door. The food was pedestrian and the delivery person hit me up for a tip in cash- a rather odd exchange. No silverware came with the meal - the idea was to use the silver from the kitchen but then plates and silver stayed until the next morning. Otherwise, my stay was good and I would go back. It is away from the hustle and bustle but very well located."}

A juice and coffee costs about the same as an entree.\nCourtesy car was great, Joe and Rashid were both very friendly and responsive, will take you anywhere within downtown quickly.\nOnly complaints I had were the size of the room and the second day my room was not serviced until after 3pm, which of course was when I was at the gym and coming back to shower and finding I could not get in, waiting 20 minutes outside which was slightly annoying, but just unlucky."}
